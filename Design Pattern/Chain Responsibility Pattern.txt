///chain of responsibility pattern


/*

-> The Chain of Responsibility design pattern allows for a chain of different objects (that inherit from the same class/interface), to pass on the responsibility of executing a piece of logic to another object.

example : 

Employees
Employees can clear any expenses between 0100.
Boss
If the employee has an expense bigger than that, they can approach their boss, who has the ability to clear a expense between 1011000.
CEO
Any more than that then the employee needs to approach the CEO of the company who puts a strict limit of 10,000 on any expense. Anything else is likely to not get approved by the company.
